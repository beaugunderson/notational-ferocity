Notational Ferocity
===================

A semi-clone of [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) for Windows.

I'm attempting to follow the ['One Thing Well'](http://onethingwell.org/) ethos with it.

Features
--------

- Saves as you type
- Files are stored as plain text
- Supports saving notes within subdirectories and filtering by extensions (useful if you mix text and non-text content inside your notes directory)
- Updates automatically if notes are renamed, moved, or deleted outside of the application (useful for Dropbox users)
- User-specified fonts and colors

TODO
----

- Performance improvements while typing into the editor
- Simplenote sync?
- Nice styling
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Better context menus
